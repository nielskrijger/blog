While analyzing blocked sessions in Oracle DB I wrote this query showing the more interesting session details and metrics:

- Session details like machine, user, sid, ...
- Blocking status
- Number of hours running
- Average hourly IO count (our DBA is always pointing to limiting our IO, but I've never actually measured it)
- Average hourly processing time in milliseconds
- Program memory usage (PGA only)

(tested on Oracle Database 11g Enterprise Edition Release 11.2.0.3.0)

```sql
WITH
  sess_time AS (
    SELECT sid, ROUND(SUM(value) / 1000, 0) AS milliseconds
    FROM gv$sess_time_model
    GROUP BY sid),
  sess_io AS (
    SELECT sid, block_gets + consistent_gets + physical_reads + block_changes + consistent_changes + optimized_physical_reads AS io#
    FROM gv$sess_io io)
SELECT
  p.spid, -- The system process identifier
  s.sid, -- The session identifier
  s.serial#,
  /*
    Status:
    - ACTIVE - Session currently executing SQL
    - INACTIVE
    - KILLED - Session marked to be killed
    - CACHED - Session temporarily cached for use by Oracle*XA
    - SNIPED - Session inactive, waiting on the client
    */
  s.status,
  s.machine,
  s.username,
  s.osuser,
  s.program, -- The program in process
  /*
    The blocking session status indicates whether there is a blocking session. Values are:
    - VALID - there is a blocking session, and it is identified in the BLOCKING_INSTANCE and BLOCKING_SESSION columns
    - NO HOLDER - there is no session blocking this session
    - NOT IN WAIT - this session is not in a wait
    - UNKNOWN - the blocking session is unknown
  */
  s.blocking_session_status,
  ROUND((SYSDATE - s.logon_time) * 24, 1) AS "HOURS LOGGED ON",
  ROUND(sess_io.io#  / (SYSDATE - s.logon_time) / 24, 0) AS "AVG HOURLY IO#",
  ROUND(sess_time.milliseconds  / (SYSDATE - s.logon_time) / 24, 0) AS "AVG HOURLY PROCESS TIME (ms)",
  ROUND(p.pga_used_mem / 1024, 0) AS "PGA USED MEM (kB)" -- Program global area memory space usage in KB
FROM
  gv$session s,
  sess_time,
  gv$process p,
  sess_io
WHERE
  s.paddr = p.addr
  AND sess_time.sid = s.sid
  AND sess_io.sid = s.sid
  AND s.type != 'BACKGROUND' -- Exclude BACKGROUND processes, usually they just clutter the result
ORDER BY
  s.status ASC;
